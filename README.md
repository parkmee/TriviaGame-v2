# Trivia Game v2
Trivia questions and answers were stored as objects within a question bank array; this content is dynamically displayed on screen in sequential order. Guessing the correct answer will display a relevant gif. If you answer incorrectly or you run out of time on a question, Joel McHale will yell at you. Scores are tallied at the end of the game, calculating the total number correct, incorrect, unanswered, and the percentage correct.
